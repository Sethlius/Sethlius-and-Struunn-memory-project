// Introduce the game, name + rules
// Ask player if they are playing alone or with another person
// Generate random positions and assign a number to them (two positions per number)
// Draw the board of question marks as memory cards (and values get assigned to each question mark, this is not shown to the player)
//Loop starts, if one player then start timer
// Let the player navigate the cards
// Player gets to choose two cards and then they are shown what their values are and if they are the same player get 1 points and remove the values from the game, if not make them back into question marks
// If there are two players the other player is now playing
// Loop ends when all values are gone
//The player with the most points wins the game, stopping timer for one player so they can try and beat their own time.
